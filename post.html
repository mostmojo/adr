							<strong>
								Could you think back to your training and tell me about your most enjoyable memory about
								other chefs and their kitchens?
							</strong>
						</p>

						<p>
							It was when everyone was enjoying what their specific work and tasks were and that pleasure
							gets reflected back to the customer in the food.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong>
								Can you please choose one dish that was hard to learn or that did not translate between
								England and France or vice versa?
							</strong>
						</p>

						<p>
							“Gargouillou”, which is a dish of young vegetables and herbs, can only be done in the Aubrac
							region. It is located in the department of Northern Averyron at the border with Cantal and
							Lozere in central France.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong>Can you remember a mistake in a recipe that turned out to be a great idea?</strong>
						</p>

						<p>
							I wasn’t there when it happened but someone spilt muscovado sugar into a dry black olive mix
							and then it intentionally got used as an ingredient for all sorts of dishes. It was actually
							a successful combination.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong>Did you acquire any nicknames while you were training?</strong>
						</p>

						<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2> -->

						<p>
							At the age of 14, my nickname was Birdie because I looked like a newborn bird whilst I was
							working at a local hotel’s kitchen in Falkirk in Scotland.
							<br />
							<br />
							The second nickname was Nigel that I acquired at Amaryllis restaurant in Glasgow, working
							with David Dempsey, who was operating the restaurant for Gordon Ramsey in 2002. There were
							two Neil’s working in the kitchen and David had to differentiate between us.
							<blockquote class="blockquote">
								L’Ecossais was acquired during my time working with Michel Bras at Laguiole in France at his
								restaurant Bras.
							</blockquote>
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong>Could you mention one of your memories about David Dempsey who has since died?</strong>
						</p>


							The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not
							yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the
							next ten.
						</blockquote>

						<p>
							Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men.
							It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws
							of human development.
						</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

						<p>
							As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to
							the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living
							object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble
							and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

							To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all
							about.

						<p>
							Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year
							mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to
							boldly go where no man has gone before.
						</p>

						<p>
							As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a
							fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.
